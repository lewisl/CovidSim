Changes to enum and ilm models:


ilm : spread.jl 29: name of case shall be symbol

ilm : spread.jl 40: name doesn't need to be cast to symbol

enum:  what are the types of all keys, values in contact_factors, touch_factors,
            spread! lines 54, 55
            is: Dict{Int64, Dict{Symbol, Float64}}
            change to: Dict{Int64, Dict{Enum, Float64}}
            
                      
[x] enum:  check on precalculated age indices
            key is enum agegrp
            fixed dict comprehension
            
[x] enum:  check if filter used properly in spreadcases
            looks like filter is working for setting s_d_comply


enum:  end sd case by agegrp not working
            check numcontacts method using acase
        [x] check if shifter is changing the factors: works with Dict input
        [x] does limdict find mins and maxes correctly: yes
        
enum:  check: byage_idx = intersect(incase_idx, union((ages[i] for i in agegrps)...))
        [x] looks like it works

both:  don't shadow a const agegrps in spread!
        [x] enum uses include_ages for spread cases
        
    
both:  need to do shifter by agegrp: can't do across all ages

both:  input parameters should be include_idx, which can be any valid index of the 
        population, not just ages
