# Protecting the Vulnerable as a Policy and Plan

#### Initial Summary

As the states and cities of the United States consider reducing the stringency of shelter-in-place orders and social distancing guidelines, we face the most difficult policy choices. Cases and deaths rising is a simple epidemiological fact during this period. Enabling more economic activity with a return to jobs and schools for many people, while limiting deaths and possibly managing infection rates, is necessary and inevitable. Confusing guidelines and potentially insuperable implementation challenges make achieving both goals simultaneously difficult. The two quasi-options on the plate in all of the varying jurisdictions around the country, with one new proposal, seem to be: 

1. The economy or people’s economic well-being (by no means the same) is more important than a disease whose dangers are over-rated.
2. The policy of test, trace, and isolate provides protection from increased infection rates and increased deaths that will permit those who do not test positive to return to work and to many typical activities with lighter restrictions.
3. Protecting the vulnerable with lighter restrictions for others *who do not serve the vulnerable* is a new policy option that we will show enables lighter restrictions, low death rates, and high infection rates.  This is not what Sweden actually did.

Number 1 is not really an option even if it is the preference of some governments. A second rise in disease and deaths is a certainty and leads to outcomes very close to what would have occurred with never having any social distancing. Number 2 must work theoretically and actually, if it could be implemented. Administrative challenges, the very large number of people infected at this stage of the epidemic and lack of social cooperation render it nearly impossible to achieve at the high thresholds of compliance required for it to work. Number 3 sounds like Sweden. Sweden never intended for its high death rate outcome, but they did not understand this epidemic any more than any other country and did not have a plan able to meet it. Number 3 provides a credible social contract, enlists compliance among the willing, and concentrates protective resources on the segment of the population among whom nearly all deaths occur.

#### Epidemic Response to “Opening Up”

Here we show the “double dump” and a delay in reaching results that are close to no restrictions.  We also consider what might have made social distancing work against the virus, with consideration for its economic effects, though it is too late to redo early policy choices.

#### Test and Trace

Here we show the favorable impact of test and trace when implemented with very high rigor. Then we show what happens as rigorous thresholds of implentation and compliance are not met. We argue that such high thresholds are unattainable, with results that differ only a bit from more unrestricted “opening up” at higher costs and higher social frustration.

#### Protect the Vulnerable

Here we show the impact of shifting the broad public health goal from preventing infection to preventing death. We outline steps of a practicable plan to achieve the prevention of deaths among the vulnerable while allowing a return to many, but not all activities, with moderate restrictions.
